Step 1: First we need define the task 

Task Name: Resume Parser
Task Description: Take a resume as input and extract relevant information to generate a JSON output.
Input Format: We will give Resume in plain text or PDF format
Output Format: JSON object with extracted information

Step 2: Identify the Entities to Extract

Entities:
Contact Information:
Work Experience:
Skills:
Achievements 

Step 3: We need to Prepare the Training Data

Collect Resumes: Gather a large dataset of resumes in various formats (e.g., PDF, Word, plain text) and from different industries.
Annotate the Resumes: Manually annotate each resume by identifying the entities mentioned in Step which  will create a labeled dataset.
Create a JSON Template: Design a JSON template with the extracted entities as keys and empty values. This  will serve as the output format.

Step 4: Train the Model

Choose a Model: Select a suitable NLP model, such as a named entity recognition (NER) model or a transformer-based model, to parse the resume content.
Train the Model: Train the model on the annotated dataset, using the JSON template as the output format.

Step 5: Test and Refine the Model
